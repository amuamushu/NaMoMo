        <p>
          NaMoMo is a sustainability app that helps people track energy usage and in turn save money.
          It was inspired by the group's understanding of the importance of environmental protection
          and Oreoluwa's hometown that does the same thing except on paper.
          Each month when the electric company sends the biil, it also sends a breakdown showing
          what appliances were most used, how it compares to the last month and how you compare to your neighbors.
          It's the 21st century though, and we thought what better way to do this than to build an app
          that lets you take control of that information. It is our hope that we
          can partner with electric companies in order to recieve the data from them and then show people
          in real time what their electricity usage is.
